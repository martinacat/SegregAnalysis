# SegregAnalysis
An experimental tool for SNA (Social Network Analysis) that I realised as my Third Year Project. 
The tool allows to experiment with different segregation models on a network of your choice. 

## Segregation models
Three segregation models are available for now: *dissimilarity, affinity and both*. The *dissimilarity* model implemented follows the one descripted by the paper [*Emergence of segregation in evolving social networks*,
Adam Douglas Henry, Paweł Prałat and Cun-Quan Zhang](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/21/8605).
The *affinity* model follows the same reasoning used by the *dissimilarity* model, but it's based on the reveresed assumption.
The third option allows you to interleave steps of the two models.

## Getting Started 
*Coming soon*. For now just contact me if you are interested.
